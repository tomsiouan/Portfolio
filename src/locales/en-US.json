  "section-about-me-first-paragraph": "Hello! To introduce myself, I am a first-year Computer Science student, where we learn many fields such as algorithms, optimization, networks, databases, and MCD and MR representations. We do a lot of projects that bring together each module to train us and become more independent. In such projects, I am used to managing time and working in a team to ensure that we progress. I also often handle task distribution, so everyone has something to do, including myself, of course.",
  "section-about-me-second-paragraph": "I started getting interested in computer science at the age of 12, and then in middle school, I got my first computer. From that time, I really started getting into the field. Programming, video games, and mathematics fascinated me. This allowed me to continue progressing in an enjoyable field where I can develop myself and work in a team.",
