# Presentation

This project consists of the creation of a website to centrally manage and centralize my personal data.
I am also taking this opportunity to create the portfolio that I must submit to the IUT by June 13, 2024, which will be present on this site.
The portfolio is the first objective.

This project is created with nuxt3 and uses TailWindCSS.
It uses yarn as package manager.
